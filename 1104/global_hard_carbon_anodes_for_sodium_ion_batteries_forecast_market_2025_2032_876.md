<strong>Definition</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Hard carbon anodes are a crucial component in the development of sodium-ion batteries (NIBs), which are emerging as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the abundance and low cost of sodium compared to lithium. Hard carbon, a non-graphitizable carbon material, is one of the most promising anode materials for NIBs due to its favorable electrochemical properties. It is derived from various carbon precursors, including biomass, synthetic polymers, and petroleum-based materials.</p><p>
</p><p>Hard carbon anodes exhibit high specific capacity, excellent cycle stability, and low voltage hysteresis, making them a preferred choice for next-generation energy storage applications. The material’s unique disordered structure allows for efficient sodium-ion intercalation and adsorption, enhancing battery performance.</p><p>
</p><p>The market has witnessed significant growth due to the increasing adoption of NIBs in energy storage systems and electric vehicles.</p><p>Government initiatives promoting sodium-ion technology further contribute to market expansion.</p><p>Increased R&amp;D investments in battery materials have accelerated innovation in hard carbon anodes.</p><p>
