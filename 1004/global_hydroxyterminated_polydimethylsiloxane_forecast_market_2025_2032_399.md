<h1>Hydroxy-terminated Polydimethylsiloxane Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Hydroxy-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (HTPDMS) is a type of silicone polymer with hydroxyl groups (-OH) attached to its terminal positions. These polymers are widely used in various industrial and commercial applications due to their excellent properties such as high thermal stability, water repellency, and flexibility. The polymer typically has a structure of repeating dimethylsiloxane units, with average molecular weights (Mn) ranging around 550, and a viscosity of approximately 25 cSt.</p><p>
</p><p>HTPDMS finds applications in industries like electronics, automotive, medical, and personal care. The global market for HTPDMS is driven by its increasing use in the manufacture of high-performance silicones, particularly in the production of liquid silicone rubber (LSR) and high-temperature vulcanized (HTV) silicone rubber. The material is synthesized through a chemical initiation process, primarily using dodecyl radical (C12H25), with polymerization activation energy measured at 40 kJ/mol.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
