Rockwool is a versatile insulation material made from molten rock spun into fibers, known for its excellent thermal insulation, fire resistance, and soundproofing properties, widely used in construction and industrial applications.</p><p>
China's Rockwool market is growing robustly, driven by increasing focus on energy efficiency in buildings and stringent fire safety regulations. In 2023, China produced approximately 3.8 million metric tons of rockwool, with 90% consumed domestically and 10% exported. The building &amp; construction sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 65% of demand, followed by industrial applications at 25% and HVAC systems at 10%. The market saw a significant boost from China's green building initiatives, leading to a 28% increase in demand for high-performance insulation in commercial buildings in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on improving thermal performance and sustainability, with new products offering 15% better insulation values and incorporating up to 25% recycled content compared to 2020 formulations. The market is seeing strong growth in thin, high-density rockwool boards, increasing at 10% annually, driven by demands for space-saving insulation solutions in urban construction. In 2023, new fire safety regulations in high-rise buildings led to a 35% increase in the use of rockwool for fire stops and curtain wall insulation. The industry faces challenges from competition with other insulation materials, but rockwool's superior fire resistance and acoustic properties continue to secure its market position. Emerging applications in urban agriculture are showing promise, with rockwool substrates for vertical farming growing at 20% CAGR, albeit from a small base of 1.5% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from China's ambitious energy efficiency goals, with rockwool for building retrofits projected to grow at 12% CAGR through 2030.</p><p>
