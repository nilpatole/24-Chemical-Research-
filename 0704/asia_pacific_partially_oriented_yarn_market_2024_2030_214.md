<h1>Asia Pacific Partially Oriented Yarn (POY)  Market Research Report 2025-2032</h1><p>Partially Oriented Yarn (POY) is a type of synthetic filament yarn that undergoes partial stretching during production. It has an intermediate level of orientation and crystallization, making it ideal for further texturizing and drawing processes. POY is primarily made from polyester and nylon, serving as a raw material for producing drawn textured yarn (DTY) and fully drawn yarn (FDY). This yarn finds extensive applications in textiles, including apparel, home furnishings, and industrial fabrics.</p><p>
