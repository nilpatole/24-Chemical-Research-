<h1>Propylene Carbonate (PC) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Propylene carbonate (PC) is a colorless to yellowish liquid with a mild ether-like odor. It is a VOC-exempt clear polar solvent characterized by high boiling and flash points, low toxicity, and excellent stability under most conditions. Propylene carbonate is widely used in various industrial applications, including lithium battery electrolytes, industrial solvents, and as an intermediate in the production of dimethyl carbonate. Due to its non-corrosive nature and non-hygroscopic properties, it is particularly suitable for high-purity applications requiring a water-white product.</p><p>
