Recycled Polyoxymethylene (POM), also known as acetal, is a high-performance engineering thermoplastic material that has gained significant traction due to its excellent mechanical properties, durability, and high resistance to wear and fatigue. It is primarily sourced from used or discarded products, such as automotive parts, consumer goods, and industrial components. These materials undergo recycling processes that allow them to be repurposed into new, high-quality products, contributing to sustainability and reducing environmental impact.

Recycled POM plays a crucial role in various industries due to its strength, low friction, and precision characteristics. It is often used in manufacturing components for sectors like automotive, electronics, industrial machinery, and medical devices, among others. The growing focus on environmental sustainability and the demand for eco-friendly materials has contributed to the increasing use of recycled POM in various applications.
