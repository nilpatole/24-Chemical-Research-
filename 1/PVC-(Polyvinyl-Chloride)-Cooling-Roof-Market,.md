PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) Cooling Roof refers to a heat-insulating and energy-efficient roofing solution constructed using PVC wallboard. These roofs are designed to mitigate the heat absorbed by buildings, reducing indoor temperatures and improving energy efficiency. PVC cooling roofs have gained popularity in both residential and non-residential applications due to their durability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental benefits.

The primary function of a PVC cooling roof is to reflect solar radiation and prevent heat absorption. This technology helps in maintaining lower rooftop temperatures, reducing air conditioning costs, and enhancing indoor comfort. Additionally, these roofing systems contribute to sustainable building practices by improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint of buildings.
