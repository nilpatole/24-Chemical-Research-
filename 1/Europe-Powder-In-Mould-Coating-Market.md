Powder In-Mould Coating (PIC) is an advanced coating technology designed for application during the molding process of various materials, such as sheet molding compound (SMC) and bulk molding compound (BMC). This technique integrates a powder coating into the molding process to achieve decorative and functional surface properties. Unlike traditional coatings applied post-production, PIC eliminates secondary painting or finishing steps, enhancing efficiency and durability. It is widely adopted across automotive, electrical, and industrial applications due to its superior adhesion, environmental benefits, and cost-effectiveness.

Market Size
The Europe Powder In-Mould Coating (PIC) market was valued at US$ 168.45 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 242.56 million by 2030, reflecting a CAGR of 6.28% during the forecast period (2024-2030). Market expansion is driven by increased adoption in automotive (48.5%), appliances (31.6%), and industrial applications (11.8%). Germany leads the regional market with 34.8% share, reflecting the country’s strong manufacturing base. Additionally, advancements in coating quality, which have improved by 36.8%, and growing R&D investments totaling €48.6 million, are further fueling market growth.

Market Dynamics (Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities, and Challenges)
Drivers
Growing Automotive Sector: PIC is widely used in automotive components due to its high durability, corrosion resistance, and aesthetic finish. The sector’s growth, coupled with rising demand for lightweight, coated parts, is a significant driver.
