Reflective cooling paint refers to specialized paint that reduces heat absorption and provides a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight. Unlike traditional paints that absorb most of the sun's energy, reflective cooling paint uses reflective pigments and additives to bounce sunlight away from surfaces. This technology helps in reducing the ambient temperature of buildings, vehicles, and other surfaces, contributing to energy conservation and reducing urban heat island effects. The primary applications of reflective cooling paint are in construction (for buildings and infrastructure) and the automotive industry, helping to lower energy costs and reduce environmental impact.
