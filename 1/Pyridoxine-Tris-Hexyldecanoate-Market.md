Pyridoxine Tris-Hexyldecanoate (CAS 564478-51-9) is a specialized oil-soluble derivative of vitamin B6, commonly used in the skincare and cosmetic industries. This compound has gained popularity for its ability to enhance skin moisture retention by stimulating the production of fibroin, an amino acid precursor that plays a crucial role in the skin's natural moisturizing factors. As a key ingredient, Pyridoxine Tris-Hexyldecanoate has shown significant promise in moisturizing products, offering long-lasting hydration, anti-aging benefits, and improved skin texture.

It is generally used in formulations designed to address dry skin and wrinkles, offering a deeper level of skin care by replenishing the natural moisture levels. Pyridoxine Tris-Hexyldecanoate is particularly sought after for its ability to improve the effectiveness of moisture-binding compounds in the skin, helping to maintain skin elasticity and youthful appearance.

The global Pyridoxine Tris-Hexyldecanoate market was valued at approximately USD 7 million in 2023. Projections suggest that the market will grow steadily, reaching USD 8.55 million by 2032, representing a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 2.90% during the forecast period.

The demand for Pyridoxine Tris-Hexyldecanoate is primarily driven by the increasing demand for advanced skincare products that focus on long-lasting hydration and anti-aging properties.
