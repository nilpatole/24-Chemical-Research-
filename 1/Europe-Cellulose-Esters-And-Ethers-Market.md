Cellulose esters and ethers are modified derivatives of cellulose that provide enhanced functional properties for a wide range of industrial applications. These materials are produced by chemically modifying cellulose through esterification or etherification processes. The result is a family of high-performance compounds with controlled degrees of substitution and molecular weights, allowing for tailored properties such as solubility, viscosity, and film-forming capabilities.

Common types of cellulose esters include cellulose acetate and cellulose nitrate, while cellulose ethers include carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and hydroxypropyl cellulose. These compounds find widespread use in industries such as coatings, pharmaceuticals, construction, cosmetics, textiles, and printing inks.
