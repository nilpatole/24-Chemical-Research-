<h1>Europe Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Market, Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) is a synthetic calcium carbonate produced through a controlled precipitation process. Unlike ground calcium carbonate (GCC), which is obtained from natural sources, PCC is synthesized to achieve a precise particle size and morphology. This tailored structure makes PCC highly desirable for various industrial applications, including the paper industry, plastics, pharmaceuticals, paints, coatings, and adhesives. It serves as a functional additive that enhances product properties such as brightness, opacity, and dispersion.</p><p>
