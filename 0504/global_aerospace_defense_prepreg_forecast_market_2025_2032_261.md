<h1>Aerospace and Defense Prepreg Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Prepreg is a composite material composed of "pre-impregnated" fibers and a partially cured polymer matrix. The fibers, which are typically arranged in a weave, are bonded together by a resin system such as epoxy, phenolic, or thermoplastic. This advanced material is widely utilized in aerospace and defense due to its superior strength-to-weight ratio, making it an essential component in manufacturing aircraft structures, military equipment, and other high-performance applications.</p><p>
