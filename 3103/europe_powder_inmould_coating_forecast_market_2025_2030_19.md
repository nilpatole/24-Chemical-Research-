<h1>Europe Powder In-Mould Coating Market, Outlook and Forecast 2025-2030</h1><p>Powder In-Mould Coating (PIC) is an advanced coating technology designed for application during the molding process of various materials, such as sheet molding compound (SMC) and bulk molding compound (BMC). This technique integrates a powder coating into the molding process to achieve decorative and functional surface properties. Unlike traditional coatings applied post-production, PIC eliminates secondary painting or finishing steps, enhancing efficiency and durability. It is widely adopted across automotive, electrical, and industrial applications due to its superior adhesion, environmental benefits, and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>
