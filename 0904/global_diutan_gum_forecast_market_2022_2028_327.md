<h1>Diutan Gum Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Diutan Gum is a high-performance biopolymer derived from microbial fermentation, primarily produced by strains of Sphingomonas elodea. Structurally similar to xanthan gum, it is known for its exceptional stability and viscosity retention, even under extreme conditions such as high temperatures, salinity, and varying pH levels. These properties make Diutan Gum a preferred rheology modifier in industries such as oilfield drilling, construction, food processing, and agriculture.</p><p>
